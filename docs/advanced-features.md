### How this maps

* `README.md` — public showcase / SEO entry point.  
* `/docs/*.md` — deep‑dive pages (all cross‑linked via README).  
* Banner SVG already provided; place under `docs/banner.svg`.
* Existing docs (`gulf-stream.md`, `jito-github-libs.md`, `price-settings.md`) remain unchanged—README links to them.

Copy these files into your repo, commit, and push. Your project will now
look polished **and** guide visitors smoothly to every detailed doc. 🚀
